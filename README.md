**----**

**Note: This fork adds two functions to core.js that converts the quarterly earnings table into a CSV file that is auto-downloaded:**

``downloadCSV(csvContent, ticker)``
``convertDataToCSV(quarterlyData, annualData)``

**Will repeat with annual data and maybe other stuff when ready.**

* If you want to visit huskytrader's original repo without the download feature, visit that repo [here](https://github.com/huskytrader/corporate-earnings)

**----**

*Corporate Earnings is a browser extension which displays earnings data in a format similar to MarketSmith*

### Installation Instructions
**Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge / Brave**
1. Download this repo as a [ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/rocketpoweryul/corporate-earnings-dl/archive/main.zip)
1. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `corporate-earnings-main`
1. In Chrome/Edge/Brave go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions` or `brave://extensions`)
1. Enable Developer Mode
1. Drag the `corporate-earnings-main` folder anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards)

### Troubleshooting
* Make sure to read [FAQ](FAQ.md)
* If earnings data doesn't appear on top of the page, try refreshing the page and/or turning off adblocker
* On Windows make sure you have extracted the ZIP file not just listed it: right click on the ZIP and select 'Extract All...'. You may end up with an extra corporate-earnings-main folder. Make sure that folder that you drag into Chrome contains manifest.json file.
